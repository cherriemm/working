# AI in Cybersecurity



## Introduction

As technology progresses, so do the threats posed by hackers and cyber attackers. According to the FBI Internet Crime Report, 847,376 complaints of internet-related crimes and financial losses exceeding 6.9 billion dollars, a substantial increase from the previous year.

With connected devices projected to generate a staggering 79 zettabytes of data by 2025, manual analysis by humans becomes impractical, making AI an indispensable tool in the fight against cybercrime.

AI in cybersecurity establishes secure applications by default, eliminating vulnerabilities for users. By eradicating negative defaults, AI guarantees precision in detecting issues, expediting investigations, and automating response mechanisms. AI-driven solutions, such as user verification through behavioral biometrics, foster secure app development and promote a safe data ecosystem, contributing to a robust infrastructure.





### application scenarios



#### Threat Detection and Prevention

One area where AI excels is threat detection. It can analyze large amounts of data from different sources and identify unusual patterns in users' behavior, which could indicate a cyber attack. For example, if an employee unknowingly clicks on a phishing email, AI can quickly notice the change in their behavior and alert us to a potential security breach.

By automating incident response actions, such as isolating affected systems or blocking malicious activities, AI minimizes opportunities for attackers and limits the potential impact of a security breach.







#### User Behavior Analytics

AI models utilize deep and machine learning techniques to analyze network behavior and detect deviations from the norm continuously. Over time, these models self-correct and adapt, improving their accuracy in identifying anomalies and potential threats. The self-correcting nature of AI models empowers organizations with robust and reliable cybersecurity defense mechanisms capable of quickly responding to emerging cyber threats.

AI-driven behavioral analytics enhances threat-hunting processes by creating deployed application profiles and analyzing vast user and device data. This proactive approach enables organizations to identify evolving threats and vulnerabilities effectively.



#### Vulnerability Assessment and Management

As cybercriminals continuously deploy sophisticated methods, organizations struggle to manage the influx of new vulnerabilities. AI-driven solutions, such as User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA), analyze device, server, and user activities to detect anomalies and zero-day attacks. By preemptively protecting against undisclosed vulnerabilities, AI enables real-time defense against high-risk threats.





### challenges of Implementing AI in cybersecurity



#### Bias in AI security systems

Just like humans, AI systems can be influenced by bias in the data they are trained on. If the training data is biased, the AI system may produce discriminatory outcomes, impacting cybersecurity decision-making. Leading AI platforms invest in ongoing and thoughtful ML training to minimize bias in their systems and ensure fairer results.





#### Privacy and legal сomplications

AI applications in cybersecurity may involve the processing and analysis of vast amounts of personally identifiable data, raising critical privacy concerns. Before deploying AI systems, a legal examination is essential to ensure compliance with privacy regulations. In some regions, AI solutions, such as ChatGPT, may face restrictions, which can complicate deploying other AI-based cybersecurity solutions in those locations.
