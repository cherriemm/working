# AI in Cybersecurity



## Introduction

As technology progresses, so do the threats posed by hackers and cyber attackers. According to the FBI Internet Crime Report, 847,376 complaints of internet-related crimes and financial losses exceeding 6.9 billion dollars, a substantial increase from the previous year.

Cyber crimes such as phishing, scams, and data theft are increasing, putting organizations at risk. To combat these threats, organizations are turning to qualified cybersecurity teams equipped with cutting-edge technologies, including **artificial intelligence** (AI) that swiftly detect and counter malicious activities, fortifying networks against threats.

The recognition of AI's potential has led 76% of enterprises to prioritize AI and machine learning in their IT budgets, driven by the immense volume of data that necessitates analysis to identify and combat cyber threats effectively.

With connected devices projected to generate a staggering 79 zettabytes of data by 2025, manual analysis by humans becomes impractical, making AI an indispensable tool in the fight against cybercrime.

AI in cybersecurity establishes secure applications by default, eliminating vulnerabilities for users. By eradicating negative defaults, AI guarantees precision in detecting issues, expediting investigations, and automating response mechanisms. AI-driven solutions, such as user verification through behavioral biometrics, foster secure app development and promote a safe data ecosystem, contributing to a robust infrastructure.

AI can identify potentially malicious activities and threat actors, allowing organizations to predict and prevent cyber attacks before they occur. With AI-enabled automated monitoring, systems can remain safeguarded around the clock, empowering organizations to take proactive measures to protect their digital assets before any harm is done.







### application scenarios



#### Threat Detection and Prevention

One area where AI excels is threat detection. It can analyze large amounts of data from different sources and identify unusual patterns in users' behavior, which could indicate a cyber attack. For example, if an employee unknowingly clicks on a phishing email, AI can quickly notice the change in their behavior and alert us to a potential security breach.

When a potential threat is detected, AI-powered systems trigger real-time alerts and notifications to security teams, enabling prompt and effective responses. By automating incident response actions, such as isolating affected systems or blocking malicious activities, AI minimizes opportunities for attackers and limits the potential impact of a security breach.



#### Malware and Phishing Detection

AI-based cybersecurity systems demonstrate showcasing enhanced efficacy. Deep Instinct's Chuck Everette reveals that AI systems boast security rates of 80% to 92%, surpassing the 30% to 60% achieved by legacy signature-based malware detection systems.

AI analyzes email content and context to differentiate between spam, phishing attempts, and legitimate messages. Machine learning algorithms enable AI to evolve and adapt to new threats, recognizing signs of sophisticated attacks like spear phishing. Intercepting suspicious activities before they harm corporate networks is paramount.

AI systems excel at detecting phishing traps, thus thwarting potential threats. Researchers from the University of North Dakota proposed a machine learning-based phishing detection technique, achieving an impressive 94% accuracy in classifying emails as legitimate or phishing.



#### Endpoint Security

As remote work becomes more prevalent, securing endpoints becomes paramount in maintaining robust cybersecurity. Traditional antivirus solutions and VPNs rely on signature-based detection, which may lag behind emerging threats, leaving endpoints vulnerable.

AI-driven endpoint protection takes a dynamic approach, establishing baselines of normal endpoint behavior and detecting deviations in real time. By continuously learning from network behavior, AI can identify potential threats, including zero-day attacks, without needing signature updates.

With AI, organizations can enhance password protection and user account security through advanced authentication methods. AI-driven solutions like CAPTCHA, facial recognition, and fingerprint scanners automatically detect genuine login attempts.



#### Encryption

But what about encryption, which keeps our data safe? Can AI break it? Well, that's a complex question. Encrypted data is like a puzzle, and AI needs to figure out which pieces are good or bad. Breaking encryption is tough because it relies on complex math that even AI struggles with.

The good news is that encryption algorithms, like AES and SHA, are designed to be really tough to crack. They use tricks that make it hard for AI or any attacker to predict how they work. So, even though AI can do amazing things, breaking strong encryption is still a big challenge.



#### User Behavior Analytics

AI models utilize deep and machine learning techniques to analyze network behavior and detect deviations from the norm continuously. Over time, these models self-correct and adapt, improving their accuracy in identifying anomalies and potential threats. The self-correcting nature of AI models empowers organizations with robust and reliable cybersecurity defense mechanisms capable of quickly responding to emerging cyber threats.

AI-driven behavioral analytics enhances threat-hunting processes by creating deployed application profiles and analyzing vast user and device data. This proactive approach enables organizations to identify evolving threats and vulnerabilities effectively.
